Structured Data Assignment

Problem -1 

Brief Description of the Dataset -
The dataset in question contains a comprehensive collection of electronic
health records belonging to patients who have been diagnosed with a specific
disease. These health records comprise a detailed log of every aspect of the
patients' medical history, including all diagnoses, symptoms, prescribed drug
treatments, and medical tests that they have undergone. Each row represents a
healthcare record/medical event for a patient and it includes a timestamp for each
entry/event, thereby allowing for a chronological view of the patient's medical history
 Result:
 In this data set I used Logestic Regression for model creation.
